# 9 Pockets Records

A repsonsive website built with React and Tailwind CSS in a week.

The site is currently in production but if you would like to view a live version please visit https://eddiejoeybilly.netlify.app

This was my first time using tailwind CSS and have to say i am a big fan. the quick adjustment inline and having  media querires without having to go to all the css files is very handy. Slowly but surely getting used to grid/flex and all the css lingo as well as the tailwind shortcuts.

I also embedded spotify playlist and YouTube videos for the first time creating components to recycle for each band. Making reusable components was one of my key goals for this project and feel i defintely improved my process. The site was built entirely with React as it seemed appropriate for the task at hand.

I used continuous deployment with Github and Netlify to deploy the project and this means i can continue to add to it as the website develops.  It is my first time building a site for a client and am still trying to figure out how to be able to adjust data as and when they need to. Currently all folders folders that store either images or data for the site can be updated and then replace the old ones but this seems tricky for the client. I will need to investigate further to see how websites are updated and what the best practice is.
