            Since first emerging on the scene as a solo artist in 2019, 
            Mulimba (aka Ash) has been developing both a sound and an unpredictability that 
            make him one of the most exciting artists of 2021. 
            Initial releases 'Damn' and 'Your Own Blood' 
            served as solid introductory tracks and landed features in Clash Magazine, 
            lineofbestfit and support from BBC Radio 6, but Mulimba has flipped lockdown 
            into a golden opportunity to hone in on a sound that he can finally stand tall behind, 
            and the excitement is palpable </p>
