    bio="There's no point trying to understand Jacky Balfour Scott. 
    Sure, you can piece his story together: 
    born in Edinburgh, raised in Cape Town, music college in Brighton etc etc,
     but you'll never really know what he's going to do next. 
     Even those closest to him that have witnessed every high 
     and low don't pretend to know what's going on in the kid's head. 
     It's easier to sit back and just ride the rollercoaster. 
     Because with Jacky, whether it's tens of thousands of people cheering his name on some of the world's biggest stages, 
     or board games in the padded walls of the Balcarres Psychiatric Ward, one thing is always certain: 
     you're gonna be shocked, in one way or another."
